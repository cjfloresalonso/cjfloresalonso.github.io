                      At the moment, I'm fast-tracking my Bachelors of Computer Science at
                      the University of Queensland in Brisbane, where I major in Cybersecurity.
                      In complement to my university study I'm doing a few certifications, namely
                      the <it>Offensive Security Wireless Professional</it>, and <it>Offensive Security

          Because I haven't done many 3rd year subjects, I don't have any really 
          impressive projects with university. I have, however, done some interesting projects, 
          often surpassing the vast majority of the class in both grade and scope. 
          One of these was a programme that kept track of student questions, complete with a GUI, 
          written in python.
          I was the only student of 600 to implement a networked queue over multiple instances, 
          and was 1 point shy of recieveing 100% for the assignment.<br><br>
          I've also done automatic cracking of classic ciphers using Freidman and Kasiski's
          methods, written JML and proven programme correctness with it, designed and implemented databases,
          implemented Celluar Automata, and will soon modify kernals and other low-level drivers.

          Recently, I wrote the game Asteroids in C for a Computer Systems course.
          In the game, asteroids fall from the top of the screen towards a 
          spacecraft controlled by the player, and the player must destroy the asteroids to score points.
          If hit by an asteroid, the player would lose a life, and as time progressed, the asteroids 
          fell faster. On top of this, I made the asteroids have variable falling speeds (some fell faster, others slower).
          All of this had to be programmed to an LED matrix over SPI, and as an extension, to the 
          terminal over UART. In addition to taking input from the arrow keys and 
          ASDW, I also configured a joystick to be polled with the Analog/Digital Conversion
          capabilities of the ATMega324A. Finally, I used a seven segment display to 
          display the players score, up to 100. When it was graded, I exceeded full marks for the project,
          which I was especially content with given I completed it in a under a week.

        <p class="display-5 ">2018 Hackathon</p>
        <p>
          In 2018, I headed a team at a hackathon. My team developed a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" target="_blank">
            Brainfuck</a> (BF)
          self-interpreter from scratch. I was responsible for the design of
          the interpreter and integrating everyone's code together into the
          final product. It was a very interesting project, and had a few nifty
          problems to solve, namely:
          <ul>
            <li>storing the source code and child programme's tape</li>
            <li>keeping track of the various places in code</li>
            <li>actually manipulating data without detroying it</li>
          </ul>
          To overcome these problems, I devised a solution involving three kind
          of seperate sections of memory, each with their own role: one to keep
          track of what's where in the memory section, the actual memory section
          containing the child source code and the child tape, and a third
          section for copying, moving, and operating on values.
          </br></br>
          The memory section was the easiest, just load the source code symbols
          to memory, pad it a little just to be sure, and leave the rest blank.
          The memory management, however, was slightly more complicated. Since
          it
          would be a huge waste of memory if the interpreter had a fourth
          section for source code (once the code is loaded, every fourth byte
          would be empty), the memory section was split into source code and the
          child tape. This required various markings: where the
          different parts started and ended, and where the program was
          currently pointing to in each of them. This is what occupied the first
          section, with a little padding just for safety.
          </br>
          The final section was used for comparisons and moving/copying values
          around. Because BF has no branch/test statements performing conditional
          logic was done in a unique way: the cell value we were comparing was
          copied to one of these
          cells, the value we were checking for was subtracted, a boolean not applied to the cell,
          and finally if it were true, the corresponding
          branch would be executed. This was a huge pain, and the reason
          we didn't finish in the 36 hours.</br></br>
          All in all a very fun project, with some pretty complex problems to
          solve - all in my first semester of uni.

        <p>
          The past summer I wrote the Nokia classic <it>Snake</it> in C, just
          for a bit of fun. It's
          a simple little thing, but gave me experience in learning
          another library purely from the documentation. The snake
          waits around for you to press a button, then updates the game
          accordingly, and does it all again.
          A stretch goal for the project is to use this code as the base for a 
          command line Tron game,
          which is multiplayer over the internet. <br><br>

          At the moment, I'm exploring a number of disciplines in Cybersecurity, hoping to find those 
          which I like the most. While my biggest passion is penetration testing and expliot development, 
          other things like malware analysis and side-channel attacks in cryptography seem quite 
          interesting to me.

      <div class="col-lg-3  text-justify">
        <p>
          Another subject that I find interesting currently is functional programming. Over the break, I 
          hope to do a workshop on Haskell and fp as a whole; the idea of writing without 
          side effects seems facinating. Of course, Haskell's need for a garbage collector 
          means it can't be used in time critical applications, but I still
          believe that function programming can help squash bugs in software development.

          Automatic programme verification is also an area of interest for me, and whether 
          it can be used to find security expliots in open source (or otherwise sourced source code).
          Facebook's Infer seems like a promising start for such a project as it supports C and is open source,
          but mathematically representing exploits seems like a fairly complex thing to get right.

          As I'm just finishing up my <it>Offensive Security Wireless Professional</it> 
          certification, one thing that I haven't been able to learn is cracking 
          802.1X AAA servers, and any other major exploits that could arise from that.
